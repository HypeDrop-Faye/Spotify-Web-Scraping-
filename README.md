# Spotify-Web-Scraping-
Creation of a web crawling bot that extracts data from Spotify 
The purpose of this project was to extract data
Spotify concerning all the playlists of the chosen artists
in order to target new followers. The script does not use an API and goes through several steps:
- Creation of a program recovering proxies so as not to be blocked when requesting on the site
- Configuration of proxies and user agents
- Implementation of the scraping program retrieving information such as the number of likes, views, followers ... (timer, scrolling, text insertion ...)
-Data processing and cleaning of HTML tags
-Export data to Excel
